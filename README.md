# Stock Market Tools

This repository contains a collection of Python-based tools for stock market analysis and portfolio management.

## Repository Structure

The projects are located in the `projects/` directory:

- [Stock Picker](file:///Users/svc_sps/Documents/GitHub/stock-market/projects/stock-picker): A tool to calculate the necessary investment amount for reaching desired fractional share goals.
- [Dividends Builder](file:///Users/svc_sps/Documents/GitHub/stock-market/projects/dividends-builder): A tool to calculate annual dividend revenue based on a stock portfolio.

## [Dividends Builder](file:///Users/svc_sps/Documents/GitHub/stock-market/projects/dividends-builder)

The Dividends Builder tool helps you track and forecast your annual dividend income.

### Features
- Fetches real-time dividend data using `yfinance`.
- Calculates annual revenue per share and per total holding.
- Supports CSV-based portfolio imports.

## [Stock Picker](file:///Users/svc_sps/Documents/GitHub/stock-market/projects/stock-picker)

The Stock Picker tool computes the investment needed to achieve specific fractional share targets.

### Features
- Uses `yfinance` to get current market prices (specifically `regularMarketDayHigh`).
- Calculates the gap between current holdings and an `OPTIMAL_SHARE` target.
- Generates visual reports using `matplotlib`.

## Setup and Issues

### LZMA/XZ Dependency
If you encounter issues with `yfinance` or `lzma` imports, you may need to install the `xz` package. On macOS, this can be done via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install xz
```
